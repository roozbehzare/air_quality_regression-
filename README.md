# Air Pollution Prediction (PM2.0)

This repository contains a **machine learning project** designed to predict **PM2.0, an indicator of air pollution**. The goal is to apply machine learning techniques to analyze environmental data and estimate pollution levels, showing how data science can help in understanding real-world problems like air quality.

## ⚠️ Important Note
Currently, this project is **not fully running** due to the limited computing power of my personal computer. If you have a more powerful system, you are welcome to clone this repository and try running the code yourself. Feedback and contributions are always appreciated.

## 🚀 Future Work
- Running and testing the models fully  
- Improving performance and accuracy  
- Adding results and visualizations  

## 📌 Status
This is a **work in progress**. I plan to update and improve it in the future when I have access to more resources.

## 🙌 Contributions
Suggestions, feedback, and pull requests are welcome!  
If you are interested in **machine learning, data analysis, or environmental studies**, feel free to explore and contribute.
