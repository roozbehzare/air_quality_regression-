# Air Pollution Prediction (PM2.0)
 This repository contains a machine learning project designed to predict PM2.0, an indicator of air pollution. The goal is to apply machine learning techniques to analyze environmental data and estimate pollution levels, showing how data science can help in understanding real-world problems like air quality.

# âœ… Project Status

The project is now fully running and tested. After recent updates, the models were successfully executed, and the workflow completed without issues. The code produces predictions as expected, making the project a functional tool for air quality analysis.

# ðŸš€ Future Work

Further improving model performance and accuracy

Expanding the dataset for more robust results

Adding enhanced visualizations and analysis reports
